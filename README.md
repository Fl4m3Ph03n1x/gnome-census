# Front-end gnome-census Angular 1

This is a small demo project that uses a sample backend server using Nodejs and
a front-end interface using Angular 1.

##  Run server locally

1. Clone the reop
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Have fun!

## Front-end client

For your amusement, the front-end client is currently connected to a Cloud9
server. So technically, you don't need to run the server locally.
